title: Call for Papers
---

The UK AI Community is pleased to announce the second UK AI Conference on Friday 8th November 2024. 
In addition to plenary talks, the conference will also include short talks and poster presentations. We invite the submission 
of papers for talks, and abstracts for posters, to be presented at the conference. This event will allow researchers nationwide 
to share work on all aspects of AI, from theory and development to application and real-world implementation. Topics include but 
are not limited to:

- Machine Learning theory
- Large Language Models
- Generative AI
- Ethics and Trustworthy AI
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- AI for Science and Healthcare
- Smart Cities
- Digital Twins

Abstracts for posters must be no more than 300 words. Papers must be no more than eight pages. Pre-prints will also be accepted. We will 
go through a double-blinded peer review process. Successful submissions will be selected to present at the 2024 UK AI Conference. Successful 
paper submissions will be published in the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/){:target="_blank"}. Papers must 
follow a one-column style similar to the standard [JMLR style](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/jmlr){:target="_blank"} (although you'll need 
to set the header to read "Proceedings of Machine Learning Research" instead of "Journal of Machine Learning Research").  

The UK AI community aims to bring like-minded people together, forging and strengthening collaborations, and more. We especially encourage 
early career researchers to submit an abstract or paper to the upcoming conference.

**Important Dates:**

- Abstract/paper submission deadline: **Friday 6th September 2024**
- Notification of decisions: **Friday 11th October 2024**
- Conference dates: **Friday 8th November 2024**

We look forward to receiving your submissions and welcoming you to the conference.
